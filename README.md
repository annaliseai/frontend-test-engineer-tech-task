# Annalise Webdemo

This is a technical assessment task for the [Test Engineer (Frontend)](https://jobs.lever.co/annalise/85329349-1c62-4f03-afda-1bd7ba3e5d4d) role at [annalise.ai](https://annalise.ai/)

Your task is to improve on some existing tests that have been written by software developers given a set of requirements.

You may implement it using either JavaScript or preferably TypeScript, and are welcome to use external open-source libraries if desired.

## Overview

Implement the requirements described below and push your solution to GitHub for discussion in the scheduled technical interview. You are welcome to use a private repository as long as it is visible to `@mkerollos` `@danrauv` `@cgcurta` `@LWilliams-Annaise` `@lucitemple` `@nich1jb` `@RicoJap` and `@noejon`.

You will be given the email address of a member of the team, and should email this person with a link to your solution at least 24 hours before the scheduled technical interview. You're also encouraged to email them with questions at any time while working on this task.

**Please don't spend more than a few hours on this task.**

It's small exercise to allow you to demonstrate your abilities in test automation, how you break down a problem, how your structure your tests, how you communicate about it with your potential future team-mates.

We'll be looking for clear, concise and maintainable tests as well as your ability to verify the correctness of your solution. You are encouraged to treat this as though you were creating tests for a real project though we will **not** be looking for micro-optimisations or for every single detail to be carefully polished.

We encourage you to include a README that describes how to run the tests and a description of your approach. Here are some questions we recommend you answer:

* How and when would you run these tests?
* What was missed in this implementation?
* What would you have liked to have added?

## Task

Using our [webdemo](https://cxrdemo.annalise.ai/)

* Using a JavaScript framework of your choice implement end to end tests that test the system requirements
* Provide input on improving the system requirements
* Looking at the [webdemo](https://cxrdemo.annalise.ai/), could you think about a requirement and implement a test for your chosen requirement?

System requirements:

1. The user can open a pre-defined study in the web viewer
2. The user can upload a study and see the result in the web viewer
